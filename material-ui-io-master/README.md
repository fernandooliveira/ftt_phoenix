Material-UI-IO is a fork off [Material-UI](http://callemall.github.io/material-ui/) that uses [React v0.14 Beta](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/07/03/react-v0.14-beta-1.html). This is **NOT** meant to be a replacement for Material-UI and this is **NOT** production battle tested (maybe?) so use it at your own risk. Material-UI-IO exists for people to use Material-UI with the latest beta version of React so they don't have to depend on the framework to use the latest and greatest.

## Prerequisites

We recommend that you get started with the [React Library](http://facebook.github.io/react/) before diving into material-ui for a better understanding. Should you choose to skip this, don't worry, we'll explain relevant React concepts as they come along.

## Installation

Material-UI-IO is available as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.org/package/material-ui-io).
```sh
npm install material-ui-io
```
After npm install, you'll find all the .jsx files in the /src folder and their compiled versions in the /lib folder.

### Differences between Material-UI and Material-UI-IO
Unlike Material-UI, Material-UI-IO does not use [react-tap-event-plugin](https://github.com/zilverline/react-tap-event-plugin). The API for onTouchTap has been replace with onClick.

### Roboto Font
Be sure to include the [Roboto](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto) font in your project.
Here are [some instructions](http://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Roboto:400,300,500) on how to include it in your project.

## Usage
Check [Material-UI](http://callemall.github.io/material-ui/) for their documentation

## Webpack
If you're using [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), easily move to Material-UI-IO by aliasing `material-ui` to `material-ui-io` in your config like so:

```js
resolve: {
  alias: {
    'material-ui': 'material-ui-io'
  }
}
```
